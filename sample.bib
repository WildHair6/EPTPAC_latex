	abstract = {In this paper, we present a new prescribed-time distributed control method for consensus and containment of networked multiple systems. Different from both regular finitetime control (where the finite settling time is not uniform in initial conditions) and the fixed-time control (where the settling time cannot be preassigned arbitrarily), the proposed one is built upon a novel scaling function, resulting in prespecifiable convergence time (the settling time can be preassigned as needed within any physically allowable range). Furthermore, the developed control scheme not only ensures that all the agents reach the average consensus in prescribed finite time under undirected connected topology, but also ensures that all the agents reach a prescribed-time consensus with the root's state being the group decision value under the directed topology containing a spanning tree with the root as the leader. In addition, we extend the result to prescribed-time containment control involving multiple leaders under directed communication topology. Numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed control.},

In this paper we present an alternative to these approaches, which, while lacking optimality, provides explicit time-varying feedback laws that achieve regulation in prescribed finite time, even in the presence of non-vanishing (though matched) uncertain nonlinearities. Our approach employs a scaling of the state by a function of time that grows unbounded towards the terminal time and is followed by a design of a controller that stabilizes the system in the scaled state representation, yielding regulation in prescribed finite time for the original state. The achieved robustness to right-hand-side disturbances is not accompanied by robustness to measurement noise, which is also absent from all controllers that are nonsmooth or discontinuous at the origin.

First, a prescribed-time sliding mode guidance law is presented based on a periodic delayed sliding mode surface, which can ensure the prescribed-time convergence of both the line-of-sight angular rate and the line-of-sight angle. Second, a prescribed-time extended state observer is proposed to acquire the precise disturbance estimation within the prescribed settling time. In contrast to other finite-time or fixed-time disturbance observer, the convergence time of the proposed observer is concise and easy for tuning. Finally, by incorporating the estimated disturbance into the original prescribed-time sliding mode guidance law, a composite guidance law with prescribed-time convergence is developed, where chattering is completely eliminated. In particular, the convergence time of the proposed prescribed-time extended state observer and prescribed-time sliding mode guidance law can be arbitrarily assigned and prescribed in advance.

Each follower is described by a rigid spacecraft model subjects to parameter uncertainty, actuator saturation, and the disturbance. First, two fixed-time sliding mode estimators are introduced to estimate the reference attitude variable and the reference angular velocity, respectively. Then, by selecting the attitude errors as the system states, an attitude tracking error system for the spacecraft formation is established. An extended state observer is applied for computing the total disturbance in the attitude tracking error system. Based on the estimations of the extended state observer and two sliding mode estimators, a novel distributed controller is proposed to force the states of the established attitude tracking error system converge to a small region in preassigned finite time by using two modified time-varying barrier Lyapunov functions. The practical preassigned finite-time stability of the resulting closed-loop system is proven by Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, some simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the developed preassigned finite-time attitude synchronization control scheme.},

With the aim to satisfy the salient requirements of these robotic tasks, this paper presents an integrated robust controller. The contour is encoded by using a robust velocity field, such that, any particle immerse in such field converges in predefined-time to a predefined vicinity of the given contour. Then, a robust controller is proposed to enforce the velocity field, in turns, in predefined-time. In this sense, a predefined-time-precision contour tracking is assured, by considering a robust controller that does not assume the exact knowledge of the robot parameters for its real-time implementation.

	abstract = {High-precision and fast-response attitude control of launch vehicles plays an increasingly important role in numerous space launch missions, ensuring the efficiency of space transportation. However, disturbances caused by liquid sloshing and external environments degrade the control performances seriously. Because of the complicated coupling with control inputs and angular acceleration, the dynamics of liquid sloshing disturbance are highly uncertain. Therefore, it is urgent to develop novel disturbance estimation methods for launch vehicles by thoroughly analyzing disturbance dynamics. In this paper, an observer-based predefined-time attitude control method aimed at achieving precise and rapid estimation of liquid sloshing disturbance and other external disturbances is proposed. More specifically, a prescribed-time reduced-order state observer is proposed for estimating the liquid sloshing disturbance and the unmeasurable system state, leveraging the specific characteristics and inherent coupling relations of liquid sloshing disturbance. Additionally, a prescribed-time extended state observer is introduced for estimating external disturbances and nonlinear terms. Subsequently, by employing a predefined-time output feedback controller, a composite control law is proposed to enhance the antidisturbance capabilities of rigid-liquid coupled launch vehicles. Finally, simulation examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Based on the proposed predefined-time criterion, a nonlinear disturbance observer is then developed to reconstruct the system uncertainties and environmental disturbances. The observer is capable of driving the estimation error to the origin within a specific time, even if the initial estimation error is exceedingly large or infinite. The proposed observer does not require the assumption of continuous differentiability or negligible variation of the total uncertainties. Hence, a wide range of disturbances can be handled. Based on the estimated uncertainties, a nonsingular predefined-time sliding mode attitude tracking controller is developed. It is guaranteed that the attitude system is globally predefined-time stable and the attitude trajectory converges to the reference trajectory from anywhere in the state space within a predefined time.

First, aiming at the problem that the control magnitude may grow violently while approaching the predefined time, we introduce an exponential controller to compensate for the predefined time controller. Then, fixed time disturbance observers (FTDOs) are designed to estimate the unknown external disturbances and unmodeled terms of the fixed-wing UAV. The nonlinear input saturation is linearized by a Gaussian error function and addressed by auxiliary variables. Through rigorous analysis, we prove that FTDOs will converge within a fixed time and that tracking errors are bounded within this period. In the presence of input saturation, the tracking errors can converge to zero within a predefined time, irrespective of the initial states. The results of numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed protocol can guarantee the convergence of the tracking errors within a predefined time. That is, the EPTC protocol has a spatio-temporal characterization. The change in the control magnitude is moderate compared with the existing works, which is more suitable for the fixed-wing UAV. Moreover, the flight test realizes the extension on a real fixed-wing UAV and verifies the practical feasibility of the proposed spatio-temporal trajectory tracking protocol.},

We assume that the UAV is equipped with longitudinal and lateral autopilots which reduces the 12-state model to a six-state model with altitude, heading, and velocity command inputs. One of the novel features of our approach is that we explicitly account for heading rate and velocity input constraints. For a UAV, the velocity is constrained to lie between two positive constants, and therefore presents particular challenges for the control design. We propose a control Lyapunov function (CLF) approach. We first introduce a CLF for the input constrained case, and then construct the set of all constrained inputs that are feasible with respect to this CLF. The control input is then selected from this "feasible" set. The proposed approach is applied to a simulation scenario, where the UAV is assigned to transition through several targets in the presence of multiple dynamic threats.},

	abstract = {Attitude planning of rigid bodies has many applications in robotics and aerospace. However, because the attitude configuration space is non-Euclidean and the constraints are complex and non-linear, the design of the attitude curve has always been a tricky problem. In this paper, a gradient-based attitude planning method is proposed to simultaneously handle attitude pointing, angular velocity, torque, and time constraints on Lie group \$\{{\textbackslash}rm{\textasciitilde}SO\}(3)\$. Firstly, the attitude interpolation algorithm on \$\{{\textbackslash}rm{\textasciitilde}SO\}(3)\$ gives an attitude curve connecting the initial and target attitudes. The shape of the curve is determined by the fitting coefficients and maneuvering time. Secondly, to match the curve with suitable angular velocity and control torque, a nonlinear planning model with fitting coefficients and maneuver time as decision variables is proposed. Solving the problem gives a smooth attitude curve that satisfies both kinematic and dynamic constraints and also avoids complicated time allocation. Then, to apply the gradient-based solver, analytical formulas for the derivatives of each order of the attitude curve with respect to the decision variables are given in this paper. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by a series of numerical simulations.},

	abstract = {The paper deals with the problem of time-optimal spacecraft reorientation maneuvers by means of reaction wheels, with boundary and path constraints. When searching for solutions to optimal attitude-control problems, spacecraft can be easily modeled as controlled by external torques. However, when using actuators such as reaction wheels, conservation of the total angular momentum must be taken into account and the wheel dynamics must be included. A rest-to-rest slew maneuver is considered where an optical sensor cannot be exposed to sources of bright light such as the Earth, the Sun and the Moon. The motion must be constrained to prevent the sensor axis from entering into established keep-out cones. The minimum-time solution is proposed using the Inverse Dynamics Particle Swarm Optimization technique. The attitude and the kinematics of the satellite evolve, leading to the successive attainment of the wheel control input via fixed-step numerical integration. Numerical results are evaluated over different scenarios. It is established that the computation of minimum time maneuvers with the proposed technique leads to near optimal solutions, which fully satisfy all the boundary and path constraints. The ability to converge in a variety of different scenarios always requiring the same computational effort characterizes the proposed technique as a feasible future on-board path-planner.},

Next, a prescribed-time attitude control law is proposed by utilizing the estimated state of the leader spacecraft. In the proposed control law, an adaptive compensation law is used to compensate the input saturation. Furthermore, the prescribed-time stability of multispacecraft system subject to input saturation under the proposed scheme is analyzed in theory and simulation. The simulation results show the high reliability and effectiveness of the scheme.},

This concept allows for the design of observers and controllers for problems that require to fulfil hard time constraints. An example is encountered in the fault detection and isolation problem, where mode detection in a timely manner needs to be guaranteed in order to apply a recovery action. Furthermore, through the notion of strong predefined-time stability, the approach hereinafter presented permits to overcome the problem of overestimation of the convergence time bound encountered in previous methods for the analysis of finite-time stable systems, where the stabilization time is often an unbounded function of the initial conditions of the system. A Lyapunov analysis is provided together with a detailed discussion of the applications to consensus and first order sliding mode controller design.},

	abstract = {To address the predefined-time robust attitude tracking control of flexible spacecraft with both external disturbances and model uncertainties, this paper proposes an adaptive terminal sliding mode controller. A modal observer is designed to estimate the unmeasured modal information of flexible attachments, and the estimation error is regarded as a part of the lumped disturbance. The term with a power index less than one in the terminal sliding mode is replaced by a piecewise function such that the controller is global nonsingular. To ensure the continuity of the applied control torque to avoid chattering phenomenon, the signum function in the robust term is replaced by the hyperbolic tangent function and its influence on control accuracy is analyzed quantitatively. The Lyapunov stability analysis shows that the attitude tracking error can be drawn into a small neighborhood near zero before the specified time which can be easily adjusted during the controller design without initial conditions constraint. Finally, we evaluate the predefined-time convergence performance by numerical simulations.},

The proposed controller guarantees that before a known time, which is predefined during the control design, two chaotic systems are synchronised, enforcing a predefined-time sliding mode synchronisation. Numerical simulations are presented in order to show the reliability of the proposed method. Firstly, an application to secure communication is addressed, showing that, after the synchronisation is achieved, the exact message reconstruction is performed through a two-channel communication protocol, one channel for transmitting the message, and the other one for maintaining the synchronisation. An additional simulation case, about the synchronisation of two Rössler systems, is presented to show the applicability of the proposed scheme in a different chaotic system.},

On the one hand, (both local and global) finite-time stability of general nonlinear time-varying systems is investigated by the comparison principle and the notion of finite-time escaping functions. Some Lyapunov-like stability theorems are established. On the other hand, finite-time and prescribed-time stabilization of linear systems by bounded linear time-varying feedback are revisited based on the proposed finite-time stability theorems. Two classes of new time-varying high-gain functions are proposed to reduce the regulation time. Some connections of the proposed results to existing results on Lyapunov-inequality based finite-time stability analysis and nonlinear feedback based finite-time stabilization are revealed. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is illustrated by a numerical example.},

The software employs a Legendre-Gauss-Radau quadrature orthogonal collocation method where the continuous-time optimal control problem is transcribed to a large sparse nonlinear programming problem (NLP). An adaptive mesh refinement method is implemented that determines the number of mesh intervals and the degree of the approximating polynomial within each mesh interval to achieve a specified accuracy. The software can be interfaced with either quasi-Newton (first derivative) or Newton (second derivative) NLP solvers, and all derivatives required by the NLP solver are approximated using sparse finite-differencing of the optimal control problem functions. The key components of the software are described in detail and the utility of the software is demonstrated on five optimal control problems of varying complexity. The software described in this article provides researchers a useful platform upon which to solve a wide variety of complex constrained optimal control problems.},
